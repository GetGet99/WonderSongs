# WonderSongs

WonderSongs is an experimental project I'm making. It's basically a music player that plays the playlist of songs (a folder of music files).

Near the end of the currently playing song, it'll give you a few options for the next song you'd like to listen to! You can then select one of those for the next up item.

The items you selected before will have lower chance of appearing, making sure you go through most of the songs you put in the folder!
